        <p>Hello! I'm Pedro Alves, a 22-year-old from Brasília, Brazil. I recently completed a mission and currently work as a call center agent. I'm really enjoying being a BYU student and I'm excited about the WDD130 intro to web development course! In my free time, I enjoy gaming, spending time with friends, skating, and exploring the world of coding. I'm very excited to expand my programming skills.<br> Let's code!</p>
